# Javascript Calculators

Javascript Calculators

This was my first project after learning javascript.

I coded three calculators. A unit converter, a Bmi calculator and a Tip calculator.

I learned how to handle inputs from the user and some DOM Manipulation

You can check the demo here: https://nicholasfc.github.io/Unit-Converter/.
